# ThatsFuckingFunny
My First Project; Currently left unfinished for nostalgic reasons. 
Perhaps one day I shall make a finished version but, for now it feels like altering one of my childhood paintings.

So, around 2014 this idea began to be crafted and I considered it a hefty undertaking at the time. Some heavy modifications were done in
early 2015 but, by June of 2015 most work on it stopped. Earlier on, by January of 2015, any work on the project was sparse. At the moment,
the jQuery function that is necessary to allow the dropdown navbar buttons to work needs to be copy/pasted into the file and in the future
some new pages need to be added, along with a log-in/sign-up system complete with a database, as well as a resource to allow a cycling
list of streamed videos. 
  I have thought up some ideas regarding this, It would simply need actives links to YouTube (or other) videos in a database. 
To obtain these i've considered having a .bat file activate a python script once a day or possibly a week and to add the top 
100-1000 trending videos on YouTube into an Sqlite3 database. From there, these videos would be linked into various parts of 
That's Fucking Fucking.com to theoretically be watched, and rated "Fucking Funny" or "Fucking Stupid", just as one would on a 
similar video streaming website, except since this is going to forever remaing a concept idea, it was never have a database of actual video 
files to act as a host to stream from, rather simply as a medium to link users to the true host of the streamed videos.
